PyMS is a modular software for processing of chromatography-mass spectrometry data, currently primarily tested for the processing GC-MS data. PyMS consists of three projects:

  * [pyms](http://code.google.com/p/pyms/) -- PyMS project
  * [pyms-docs](http://code.google.com/p/pyms-docs/) -- Documentation (**this project**)
  * [pyms-test](http://code.google.com/p/pyms-test/) -- Tests & examples

All three parts of PyMS are hosted on Google Code as separate projects, and are freely available for download.

The data files for examples can be downloaded from
